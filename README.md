Mental Health Detection Website
Introduction
This project is a website designed for mental health detection, aiming to provide users with a platform to assess their mental health condition and seek appropriate support. The website features a main form with 20 questions randomly chosen from a CSV file containing 50 questions (MH.csv). Additionally, there are individual survey forms for depression, anxiety, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), and PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Users can also engage with a chatbot for further assistance.
